# Job Shop Scheduling Problem Solver using Genetic Algorithm

Welcome to my genetic algorithm implementation for solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This project aims to provide an efficient solution to JSSP, which is a complex combinatorial optimization problem.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:
- Python 3
- Git

**Clone the Repository**

   Clone the `amr_constraints` branch of the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone -b amr_constraints https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
   ```
### Running the Algorithm

To run the genetic algorithm for solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem, execute the `JobShopGAimpl.py` file:

```bash
python JobShopGAimpl.py
```
